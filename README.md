# Deep Reinforcement Learning 

## Introduction
* This **Repository** contains multiple Projects on Reinforcement Learning. The problems and supporting documents are taken from udacity `deep-reinforcment-learning-nanodegree` github page [udacity deep reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning)

* This repository is solely made for RL enthusiastic people to explore the works of Reinforcement learning and exploit its use cases. 

## Installation 
All the RL algorithms are tested on Open Ai gym simulations. All simulations are done in the jupyter notebook, Anaconda.
* Installing Anaconda [Anaconda installation](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* **Do not forget to activate a new environment before proceeding**
#### **Before proceeding, its highly recommended to install all the relevant packages in the new environment (Anaconda).**
* `conda create -n myenv python=3.7`
* **Libraries needed for installation**
* `conda install -c anaconda numpy`
* `pip install gym`
* `pip install pyglet`
* `pip install gym[box2d]`
* For more information visit [open ai gym installation](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-install-openai-gym-in-a-windows-environment-338969e24d30)
The followings are packages that are required for working with the repository.

## Working with the repository
* Each of the folders are marked with algorthm_simulation where the algorithm is the algorithm used to solve the simulation mentioned in open ai gym environment tab [Open AI Gym Environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/)

## Cheetsheet :
* You can also take help from udacity Deep Reinforcment Learning cheetsheet [cheetsheet](https://github.com/akashkmr27089/Deep-Reinforcemnt-Learning-ALL-/blob/master/cheatsheet.pdf)

## Contribution
* Contribution to this repo is very much appreciated. You can also leave me feedback for any improvements.
